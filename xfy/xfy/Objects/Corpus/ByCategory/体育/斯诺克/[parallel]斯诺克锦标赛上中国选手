    "content_cn": "昨天的传奇一战吸引了电视机前的百万观众。战场是在英国谢菲尔德举行的斯诺克世界锦标赛。交战双方是中国的丁俊晖和梁文博。\n首场开场丁俊晖表现出色，第二场开场连赢两局巩固了前一天的优势地位，以5-4的成绩领先梁文博。\n但是梁文博强势反攻，连续拿下后面四局，以微弱优势领先同胞选手。\n一小时未进球之后，丁俊晖赢得比赛的几率似乎渺茫。但是随后他单杆111分清台逆转，拿下第16局。随后又分别取得91和63决胜成绩。\n这位目前排名11位的球手接下来要面对的是夺过七次世界冠军的斯蒂芬·亨得利。亨得利曾在去年谢菲尔德比赛中击败丁俊晖，而丁可能还在回味2005年中国公开赛上与这位苏格兰人交战的胜利。在决赛中，他在4:1落后的形势下，以9:5逆袭亨得利反败为胜，让北京的观众兴奋不已。\n现斯诺克世界冠军罗尼·奥沙利文认为丁俊晖具有最终夺冠的实力。据报道，他以前曾说过：“网球有费德勒，高尔夫球有老虎伍兹，丁一样可以称霸斯诺克。”\n但是今年奥沙利文本人却是人们关注的焦点。这位世界冠军最近因为在中国公开赛期间的一次新闻发布会上言论粗俗而被审查。\n尽管如此，奥沙利文仍是这次锦标赛冠军的热门人选。在打败斯图亚特·宾汉姆的第一轮比赛的第二局中，“火箭”（奥沙利文的绰号）只用了七分钟就单杆拿下140分。\n但奥沙利文一点也不骄傲自满。比赛结束后人们当被问到如果满分是十分给自己打几分时，他说：“大概五分,的样子。”\n",

    "content_en": "Millions of TV viewers were gripped by an epic battle yesterday. The arena: the snooker World Championship in Sheffield, England. The combatants: Chinese players Ding Junhui and Liang Wenbo.Ding began the session well, cementing an overnight lead with a further two frames to take him 7-4 ahead of Liang.But Liang rallied magnificently, taking the next four frames to give him a narrow lead over his compatriot.Having failed to pot a ball for over an hour, it looked like things might be over for Ding. But then he produced a clearance of 111 to take the 16th frame. Breaks of 91 and 63 on the following frames secured him the match.\nThe world number 11 now faces Stephen Hendry, a seven-time world champion. Hendry beat Ding in Sheffield last year, but Ding must still savour memories of his win over the Scotsman in the 2005 China Open. He delighted the Beijing crowd by coming from 4-1 down to beat Hendry 9-5 in the final.Current champion Ronnie O’Sullivan believes Ding Junhui has what it takes to go all the way. He is reported to have said in the past, \"Tennis has Federer, golf has Tiger Woods, Ding could do the same to snooker.\"But this year, O’Sullivan is himself the focus of most attention. The world number one was recently put under review after making lewd comments at a news conference during the China Open.Nevertheless, O’Sullivan is a favourite to win this year’s championship. In the second frame of his first-round victory over Stuart Bingham, it took ‘The Rocket’ just seven minutes to deliver a clearance of 140.Yet O’Sullivan is anything but complacent. After the game he was asked to judge his performance out of 10. He said, \"Five. Something like that.\"",
